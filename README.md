# 🛡️ VerifiX – AI-Powered Document Verification &amp; Certificate Automation

**VerifiX** is a secure, AI-driven academic document platform that enables students, colleges, and third parties to verify, request, issue, and publicly validate academic certificates using Google AI, Firebase, and QR-based verification.

It eliminates fake certificates, manual delays, and opaque approvals by combining AI forensic analysis, human-in-the-loop approval, and tamper-proof digital certificates.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Document Originality Verification
- Upload existing academic documents (Bonafide, Transcript, NOC, etc.)
- AI-based forensic analysis using Gemini:
- Logical inconsistencies
- Date conflicts
- Formatting anomalies
- Suspicious textual patterns
- Generates Explainable Trust Score with reasons
- Admin review for high-risk documents

### 🏛️ Official Certificate Request
- Students can request new certificates from the college
- Supported certificate types:
- Bonafide
- NOC
- Transcript
- Fee Receipt
- Requests follow a AI → Admin approval workflow
- Students can delete requests before admin action

### 📄 Automated Certificate Generation
- Approved requests generate official certificates using:
- Prescribed college templates
- Student details
- Authority digital signature
- Unique QR code
- Certificates generated as tamper-proof PDFs

### 🔍 Public Verification via QR Code
- Each certificate contains a QR code
- QR scan opens a public verification page
- Displays:
-- Certificate validity
-- Student email
-- Certificate type
- Purpose:Issuing authority & Verification engine

### 👨‍⚖️ Human-in-the-Loop Admin Workflow
- AI performs initial forensic analysis
- Admin reviews trust score and AI reasons
- Final approval or rejection by admin
- Full transparency in decision-making
  
### 👩‍🎓 Student Dashboard
- Two clear flows:
-- Verify existing documents
-- Request new certificates
-- Track request status in real time
-- Download approved certificates
-- Verify issued certificates anytime

### 🧠 AI Processing Flow
- Student uploads document or submits certificate request
- Firestore trigger activates Cloud Function
- OCR extraction using Google Cloud Vision
- Gemini AI performs forensic analysis
- Trust score and reasons generated
- Admin approves or rejects
- Approved → certificate PDF generated with QR code
- Certificate becomes publicly verifiable
